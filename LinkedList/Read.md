# Linked List
 Linked list are same as lists in python. The only difference is that lists use a contiguous memory block to store refrences to their data, linked list store refrences as part of their own elements.
Each element in a linked list is called node. A node has two parts they are
1) Data contains the value to be stored in the node.
2) Next contains a reference to the next node.
# Time complexities of linked list
Indexing                       ->   O(n)
Insert/delete element at start ->   O(1)
Insert/delete element at end   ->   O(n)
Inserting elements at middle   ->   O(n)
